# Sample Call Audio Files

This directory should contain the actual audio files for the sample calls:

- `manchester-inquiry.mp3` - Student asking about Manchester University area room
- `london-budget.mp3` - Hindi/English mixed budget inquiry for London  
- `birmingham-safety.mp3` - Safety-focused inquiry about Birmingham area

For development, you'll need to add real MP3 audio files here that match the sample call descriptions in the Call Copilot feature.

## File Format Requirements
- Format: MP3 or WAV
- Quality: 16kHz+ sample rate recommended
- Duration: 2-5 minutes typical
- Content: Clear speech with student housing inquiries

## ElevenLabs Integration
These files will be sent to ElevenLabs Scribe v1 for real transcription instead of using mock data.
